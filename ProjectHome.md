Welcome to the Google Search Appliance Administrative and Policy ACL API project site!

This API allows administrators of the Google Search Appliance to automate common tasks and integrate with their existing system management tools.  This project contains necessary client libraries in both Java and C# that can be used to enables programmatic control of the administrative tasks of the search appliance.  The service uses the Google Data API protocol for reading and writing data.

This code is a [Google Enterprise Labs](http://www.google.com/enterprise/labs) project and is under active development.  If you are interested in contributing to this project, please contact the project owners. Thank you!

Also, please join the [Google Enterprise Labs Discussion Forum](http://groups.google.com/group/google-enterprise-labs) after you download the software so we can keep you up-to-date on new versions and bug fixes as they are released.  You can also use the forum to ask questions, hear about new experiments that are coming, and suggest ideas for new experiments!

**Note:** This API requires version 6.0 or later of the Google Search Appliance.  Applications developed based on this API will NOT work with previously released versions of the Google Search Appliance.  This API requires that you have a user name and password for the Admin Console of a search appliance to obtain the authentication token.
